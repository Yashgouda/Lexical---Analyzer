## Introduction
This project implements a simple lexical analyzer in C. It reads a C source file and breaks it into tokens such as keywords, identifiers, numbers, operators, symbols, and more. This is the first stage of a compiler front end.

## Features
- Detects C keywords, identifiers, numbers, operators, and special symbols
- Ignores whitespace and comments
- Prints each lexeme with its token category
- Simple modular design suitable for embedded environments
